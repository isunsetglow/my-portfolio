            I'm Maria and I'm currently an Information Technology student at UCF. I'm a sucker for cherry blossoms and 
            love being behind the camera capturing beautiful moments for people to reminisce on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I've developed a huge love and interest for product design, graphic design, and front-end 
            development. As someone who loves art, technology and interacting with people, I found a good medium between 
            these occupations where I can both code and get creative at once!
